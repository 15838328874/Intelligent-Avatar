# Intelligent-Avatar
Everyone's personality is shaped by their experiences and environment. How can we make artificial intelligence learn knowledge in specific contexts, and can it possess similar characteristics to humans? We don't need an all-knowing, all-capable AI. On the contrary, we might need an AI that has a personality similar to ours, with some imperfections, to collaborate with us. I call this kind of AI a 'close friend AI.
